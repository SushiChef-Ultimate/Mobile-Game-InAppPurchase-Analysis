Kaggle Dataset: Mobile Game In-App Purchases Dataset 2025

This project explores mobile game in-app purchase data. The goal is to identify which demographics are more or less likely to purchase microtransactions—whether by gender, country, or other factors.

We also look at which genres of mobile games drive the highest spending, and which ones encourage players to start spending the fastest.

Each record represents a transaction made by a player and includes details such as gender, country, game genre, time to first purchase, and more.

I believe this dataset has strong potential for both good and harm. On the positive side, the insights can help identify the game genres people enjoy most and allow developers to create more of what players want. However, there’s also a serious risk that these insights could be misused to further optimize predatory monetization models—a problem that has plagued the mobile gaming industry historically.

The ultimate goal is to determine which combination of game genre and demographic appeal will maximize participation in microtransactions among the player base.
