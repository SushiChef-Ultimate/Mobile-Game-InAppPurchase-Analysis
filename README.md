This is an exploration of mobile game in-app purchase data. The goal here is to find which demographics of people are more or less likely to purchase microtransactions, whether that be gender, country, etc.

We are also going to find what generes of mobile games encourage the most spending, and which genre's encourage spending the fastest.

Each record represents a transaction made by a person, and contains fields such as gender, country, game genre, when they made their first purchase, and more.

I think there is both strong potential for harm and good. As for benefits, this data can be used to find the game genres that appeal to people the most, and give the people "more of what they want". However, there is also extreme potential for these insights to be used to optimize predatory transaction models for these mobile games, which has been a consistent problem historically.

The final goal is the find which combination of game genre and demographic appeal will maximize participation in microtransactions from the playerbase.
